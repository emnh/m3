This repository is a list of m3 models from Blizzard's StarCraft 2,
along with some unit properties.

It is meant to be used as a submodule of https://github.com/emnh/rts.
This keeps the parent rts independent of StarCraft 2.

It's just a list of units, so it should be okay, but it's a separate repository
for easy removal just in case Blizzard doesn't deem it fair use / derivative
work.

Original M3 assets are stored at hiveworkshop.com, which is outside of my control.
